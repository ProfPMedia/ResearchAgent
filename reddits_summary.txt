    "Excel isn\u2019t free but you might have it. Google sheets has charts too.",
    "PowerBI is going to kill Tableau. It's so easy to use and integrates with so many Microsoft apps, even PowerPoint. DAX is also pretty intuitive once you learn the core functions and concepts, which allows you to turn very complicated transformations into usable measures for any of our visuals. Don't know what the tableau equivalent is, but heard it's more complicated than it needs to be.",

    "You can use R with flexdashboard to build pretty decent panels; Python and dash/plotly are also a great combo. There is also Apache superset which is exclusively for data Viz tasks but I found it kind of confusing, and if you are working with different data sources Grafana is your tool (specially if it is real time streaming data)",
    "Shameless plug. But I\u2019m working on an app called sourcechart.io. But it\u2019s still in beta.",

    "I love Power BI. Currently using Tableau but me and my coworkers are asking if we can have Power Bi back lol.",
    "Powerbi is still behind in many aspects.",
    "Tableau has so much more integration with Python, R, and other programming languages with their build on add-ons. Especially when you start using scripts inside tableau with TabPy.",
    "You also can\u2019t use powerbi on Mac."
